**Description:**

This React application represents a simple weather app that fetches and displays weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name into an input box to instantly view weather details. The application enhances performance by making the request not for every keystroke but 200 milliseconds after the user stops typing, preventing unnecessary API calls.

The primary functionality of the application is to make an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the `axios` library and display the weather information for the specified city based on the received data. Weather information includes the city name, temperature, and general weather condition.

**Installation:**

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/username/weather-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd weather-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`

**Project Structure:**

- **src/App.js:** Main application component. Fetches and displays weather information.
- **src/City.js:** Component displaying weather information for a city.
- **src/App.css:** CSS file for styling the application.

**Usage:**

1. The main page features an input box.
2. Users type the name of the city for which they want to see weather information into the input box.
3. When typing stops, the application waits for 200 milliseconds and then fetches and displays weather information from the API.
